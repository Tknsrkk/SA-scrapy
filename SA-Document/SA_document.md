While the development is open-source, the amount of documentation about contributing is limited. This results in a project where programming is not done through conventions or guidelines but with a strong focus on getting things to work. Therefore, this document as a whole can serve as a helpful introduction to prospective developers looking to better understand the architecture to which they might contribute.
